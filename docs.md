## java documentation:

* everything is a class in java

* a public class or function is available to all other classes 

* every java class has a main function which executes first

* a static function means only a class can call for this function to execute

* void in front of a function means it does not return a value

* System.out is an object that has many functions such as System.out.println("") which is used to print a string

* running javac <filename> then java <filename> is the method to compile a java program

* final is a constant variable

* int is a regular integer whole number

* declaration statement is referred to as initially declaring a variable

* expression statement is doing some math operation on variables

* bytes, shorts, ints, and longs are all integers with different ranges (with bytes having the smallest range, and 
longs having the largest range; in order from smallest to largest range), likewise they are in order from smallest to largest bit size
, for instance: byte = 8 bits, shorts = 16 bits, ints = 32 bits, and longs = 64 bits. Ints are most commonly used,

* floats and doubles are both floating point (decimal numbers), doubles are more common and have a larger range. 
Floats are 32 bits, while doubles are 64 bits. 

* Char is a single unicode that is 16 bits

* booleans are true/false values that are less than or equal to 1 bit.
